# OpenPopSCR

Functions to simulate from and fit open population spatial capture recapture models.  

Currently fits fixed, year-specific, or sex-specific parameters.  

The basic population growth model can be found in Chandler and Clark (2014; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12153/full), 
minus the occupancy component and with year and sex-specific parameters.

No longer maintained, here for reproducibility reasons. I recommend using Nimble or the openCR package maintained by Murray Efford.
